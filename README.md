# image-repository
Image repo built with Django

This is an image repository dedicated to our furry friends! It is going to be a public web application that will make an attempt to only collect photos of our dogs or cats.
Guests must register an account with the application in order to post any images, and images must be accompanied with various data regarding information about the image.
